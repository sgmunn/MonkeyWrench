##Navigation Features
- Click to Definition, use Alt + mouse click to navigate to the definition of the symbol under the mouse pointer. This will drop a *navigation marker* that can be picked up later.
- Navigation Markers, use Alt + Shift + . to drop one and Alt + . to pick up the last marker dropped. Picking up a marker navigates you back to the location of the marker.
- Goto Next and Previous Reference, use Alt + [ and Alt + ] to navigate to the next or previous reference. The first navigation of a particular symbol will drop a navigation marker.
